# Feature Tasks: Docusaurus Base Project + Chapter 1

**Feature Branch**: `001-docusaurus-base-project` | **Date**: 2025-11-29 | **Spec**: /specs/001-docusaurus-base-project/spec.md
**Input**: Implementation plan from `/specs/001-docusaurus-base-project/plan.md`

**Note**: This file is generated by the `/sp.tasks` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/tasks.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This document outlines the detailed, actionable tasks required to set up the foundational Docusaurus project and integrate the content for Chapter 1, based on the approved specification and implementation plan. Tasks are organized by logical phases and user stories to facilitate independent development and testing.

## Task Dependencies

All tasks in a preceding phase must be completed before starting tasks in a subsequent phase. Within a user story phase, tasks are generally sequential, though some can be parallelized (marked with `[P]`).

## Phase 1: Setup - Project Initialization

- **Goal**: Establish the basic Docusaurus project structure and initial configuration.
- **Independent Test**: The `docusaurus-book` directory exists, and the `docusaurus.config.js` file is configured with the basic project title.

### Tasks

- [ ] T001 Create `docusaurus-book` directory in the repository root.
- [ ] T002 Initialize Docusaurus project in `docusaurus-book/` using `npx create-docusaurus@latest . classic --typescript`.
- [ ] T003 Install Docusaurus project dependencies in `docusaurus-book/` if not automatically handled by initialization.
- [ ] T004 Configure `docusaurus.config.js` in `docusaurus-book/docusaurus.config.js` to set the project title to "Unified Book".
- [ ] T005 Create/update `sidebars.js` in `docusaurus-book/sidebars.js` to include a placeholder for Chapter 1.

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

*(No foundational tasks identified beyond initial setup for this feature.)*

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Initialize Docusaurus Project (P1)

- **Goal**: Ensure the Docusaurus project is fully initialized, builds, and serves locally with Chapter 1 content.
- **Independent Test**: The Docusaurus site builds successfully, serves locally, and Chapter 1 is accessible.

### Tasks

- [ ] T006 [US1] Create a basic markdown content file for Chapter 1 in `docusaurus-book/docs/chapter1.md`.
- [ ] T007 [US1] Run the Docusaurus build command (`npm run build` or `yarn build`) in `docusaurus-book/` and verify successful compilation.
- [ ] T008 [US1] Run the Docusaurus serve command (`npm run serve` or `yarn serve`) in `docusaurus-book/` and verify the default site and Chapter 1 content are accessible locally.

## Final Phase: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- **Goal**: Finalize project references and ensure overall compliance.

### Tasks

- [ ] T009 Update the repository root `README.md` to include a link and brief instructions for accessing the Docusaurus book.
- [ ] T010 Perform a final check to ensure all constitutional requirements related to the Docusaurus setup are met.

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

- Within Phase 1, tasks T004 and T005 can be considered somewhat parallel once T002/T003 are complete, as they involve independent file modifications.
- Within Phase 3, tasks T006, T007, and T008 are sequential for verification, but their preparation (e.g., writing the content of chapter1.md) could overlap with earlier configuration.

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow an MVP-first approach, focusing on completing User Story 1 (Docusaurus project initialization and basic content) to deliver a verifiable, foundational book structure. Subsequent chapters and advanced features (RAG chatbot, authentication) will be tackled in future iterations, building upon this base.
