# Unified Book Project with RAG Chatbot & Enhanced Features

## **Overview**
This project is a Docusaurus-based book platform integrated with a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Chatbot. It features advanced functionalities such as chapter-wise Urdu translation, interactive text tools, and planned authentication integration.

## **Features Completed**

### **1. Book Content Structuring**
*   Divided the entire book into chapters for better accessibility.
*   Created specific folders and markdown files for each chapter in `frontend/docs`.
*   Configured the Docusaurus sidebar to ensure all chapters are navigable.

### **2. Chatbot Integration (Frontend)**
*   Added a React-based Chatbot UI in `frontend/src/components`.
*   **Created Components:**
    *   `Chatbot.tsx` & `Chatbot.css`
    *   `ThreeDotBounce.tsx` & `ThreeDotBounce.css`
*   The UI is fully interactive (open/close, typing visuals) and ready for backend connection.

### **3. Backend Setup for Chatbot**
*   Initialized **FastAPI** backend with `uvicorn`.
*   **Installed Dependencies:**
    *   `fastapi[standard]`
    *   `openai-agents`
    *   `python-dotenv`
    *   `qdrant-client`
    *   `uvicorn`
*   Backend structure is prepared to handle RAG-based logic.

### **4. Urdu Translation Feature**
*   Added a **'ترجمہ کریں (Urdu)'** toggle button at the start of each chapter.
*   Developed a reusable `ChapterTranslator` React component.
*   **functionality:**
    *   Preserves formatting (headings, lists, code blocks).
    *   Toggles between English and Urdu dynamically.

### **5. Text Selection Quick Chat**
*   **Functionality:** Users can select any text on the book pages.
*   **Interaction:** A **"Chat About This"** button appears upon selection.
*   **Flow:** Clicking the button automatically copies the selected text into the Chatbot input field.
*   **Benefit:** Allows users to immediately ask questions or request explanations regarding specific content.

## **Features in Progress**

### **Better Auth Integration**
*   **Frontend Authentication:** Implementing secure login/signup using React.
*   **Route Protection:** Securing routes (e.g., Chatbot page) to authenticated users only.
*   **Components:** Building UI for session management and authentication forms.

## **Next Steps**
*   [ ] **Connect RAG Backend:** Link the Python backend with the React frontend for full QA functionality.
*   [ ] **Implement Better Auth:** Complete frontend and backend integration for user security.
*   [ ] **Upgrade Translation:** Replace the mock Urdu translation logic with a real translation API.
